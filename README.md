## Star Wars D6 content for OpenD6 Space on Foundry Virtual Tabletop
This is a Foundry VTT module that adds Star Wars D6 Roleplaying Game content to an OpenD6 Space System game. Star Wars D6 by West End Games is an older system, out of print, and freely available.  This is not a full game system, but relies on the OpenD6 Space System, (which is also free and released under OpenD6 OGL) in Foundry Virtual Tabletop to work properly. This is a fan-compiled content module based on the fan-produced *Star Wars: Revised, Expanded and Updated* rulebook.

## Manifest URL
You can install any package in Foundry VTT by providing a direct link to its Manifest URL. This is entered at the bottom of the **Install Module** window.
```

```

## One-click Helper Configurator
This module now includes options to apply Star Wars D6 2nd Edition labels and rules options to an OpenD6 Space game with a single click in the module settings. This eliminates much of the set up for a new world in FoundryVTT. It applies [these settings](https://github.com/DarthBanjo/starwarsd6-essentialcompanion-od6s/blob/main/starwarsconfigchecklist.md) to your world. After clicking the configuration button, you may go in and change additional settings manually to set your game to your liking.

## ‚ú® Contents:
This module contains compendium packs for the following Star Wars D6 content:
- Skills & Advanced Skills 
- Force Powers and Force Skills 
- Character Templates from Star Wars D6[\*](https://github.com/DarthBanjo/starwarsd6-essentialcompanion-od6s/blob/main/templateinfo.md)
- Equipment and Armor
- Assorted Helpful Macros 
- Weapons
- Typical Gamemaster Characters
- Starfighters and their Pilots

**Note:** The Advanced skills need manual editing to set the initial value to 1D by players/GMs. This is done by setting negative values on the skill sheet. Automatic advancement does not take into effect their doubled character point cost, nor will they add their value back onto their prerequisite skills automatically. 

**Note:** Importing a character template can take up to a minute as it searches for all the skills and items.
