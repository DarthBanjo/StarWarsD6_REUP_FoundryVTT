When the power is activated, if the attacker's <em>alter </em>roll is higher than the character's resisting <em>control </em>or <em>Perception </em>total, figure damage as if the <em>alter </em>roll was a damage total and the <em>control </em>or <em>Perception </em>roll was a <em>Strength </em>roll to resist damage.</p>",
