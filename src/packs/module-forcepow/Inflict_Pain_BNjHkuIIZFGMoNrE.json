The user causes damage by rolling their <em>alter </em>skill, while the target resists damage with their <em>control</em>, <em>Perception </em>or <em>willpower</em>. Damage is figured as if the attack was a stun attack, although if the target suffers any damage at all, they are so crippled by pain that they are incapable of acting for the rest of the round and the next round.</p>",
