The Jedi can only broadcast feelings, emotions and perhaps a couple of words &mdash; this power cannot be used to send sentences or to hold conversations. The target understands that the thoughts and feelings he is experiencing are not his own and that they belong to the user of the power. If the Jedi doesn't \"verbally\" identify herself, the target doesn't know who is projecting the thoughts. This power can only be used to communicate with other minds, not control them.</p>",
