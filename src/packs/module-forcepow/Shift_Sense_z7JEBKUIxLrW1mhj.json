    "description": "<p><strong>Sense Difficulty: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Moderate for simple phenomena (such as heat or simple scents);</li>\n<li>Difficult for more uncommon phenomena (such as comm frequencies, infrared radiation);</li>\n<li>Very Difficult for specific, complex phenomena (such as setting olfactory nerves to detect the presence of Tibanna gas).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>This power may be kept up.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Required powers:&nbsp;</strong><em>Magnify Senses</em></p>\n<p><strong>Effect: </strong>The character may shift his or her senses as to detect phenomena of a different type than normal. Shifting eyesight to the infrared spectrum, hearing frequencies above or below normal range for his or her species, etc. This power counts as a &ldquo;skill use&rdquo; for determining die code penalties.</p>\n<p>Please note that this power is exceptionally useful in some aspects, but fairly limited in others. For example, a Jedi may detect comm frequencies, but that does not mean that the Jedi can listen in on the transmission. The Jedi will be able to detect that a transmission is present, but may not necessarily be able to locate the signal&rsquo;s source, and certainly will not be able to decode the information carried by the transmission.</p>",
