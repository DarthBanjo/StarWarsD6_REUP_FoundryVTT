When this power is used, the Jedi detects any attacks the round before they are made. This gives the Jedi a round to decide how to react to the danger. In game terms, if any character is going to attack a Jedi on the next round, they must declare their action the round before it happens. Characters who are going to attack the Jedi may roll their <em>control </em>skill to increase the difficulty of using the power.</p>",
