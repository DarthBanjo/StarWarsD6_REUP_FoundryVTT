    "description": "<p>The gyro-grappler was originally designed for use in the Republic military, acting as an aid to scaling walls or sheer inclines, such as mountains or cliff-faces. The gyro-grappler is essentially a large grappling hook that is equipped with powerful micro-thrusters that propel the hook (and any rope attached to it) forward. This thruster package is extremely quiet and allows throws up to 120 meters.</p>\n<p><strong>Type:&nbsp;</strong>Standard gyro-grappler</p>\n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>15</p>\n<p><strong>Availability: </strong>1</p>\n<p><strong>Game Notes: </strong>The gyro-grappler has built-in microthrusters that activate upon throwing, propelling the device forward in the intended direction. All climbing skills rolls have a bonus of + 10 for characters employing a gyro-grappler in their ascent.</p>",
