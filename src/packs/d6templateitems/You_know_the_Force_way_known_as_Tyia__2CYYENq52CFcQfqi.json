Because of the unique way in which the Tyia studies the Force, there are some special rules regarding its use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Tyia student learning&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>at 1D automatically learns&nbsp;<strong>Hibernation Trance&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Emptiness&nbsp;</strong>(which is an Easy difficulty for Tyia). The character learns an additional three&nbsp;Control&nbsp;powers.</li>\n<li>All&nbsp;<em>Alter&nbsp;</em>powers have their difficulty increased by one level.</li>\n<li>All powers have minimum&nbsp;time to use&nbsp;of one minute.</li>\n</ul>",
