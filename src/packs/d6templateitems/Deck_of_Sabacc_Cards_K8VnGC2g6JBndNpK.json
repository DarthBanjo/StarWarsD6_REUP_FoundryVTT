    "description": "<p>Sabacc&nbsp;was a popular card game that was often played for high stakes. When played professionally, the game was overseen by a dealer, either organic, as in&nbsp;Coruscant's&nbsp;Outlander Club&nbsp;(40 BBY to 10 ABY), where four-armed&nbsp;Kiughfid&nbsp;dealers passed out the cards and took up money for the house, or mechanical, as in other locales, where&nbsp;automated sabacc dealer droids&nbsp;oversaw proceedings. The game is typically played by 4 to 6 beings, and is rarely played with more than eight participants. The cards are typically electronic devices that change their value when receiving a very specific pulse that is given in random intervals. A winning hand can very quickly become a devastatingly losing hand and vice versa. The object of the game is to place bets and to be the one player with a card total 23 or the nearest total below this score. The&nbsp;Ryn&nbsp;claimed to have invented the sabacc deck and cards as a means of fortune telling.</p>",
