Each target past the first incurs a -1D penalty on the Jedi using the power (i.e, 1 target, no penalty; 2 targets, -1D penalty; 3 targets, -2D penalty; 4 targets, -3D penalty...).</p>\n<p>Each target makes either a control or Strength roll to resist, and the acting Jedi&rsquo;s alter roll result is compared to each result in turn to determine the effects. A target that is knocked back into a wall or other solid object takes the listed damage. If a Jedi kills a living being as a result of this power he immediately receives a Dark Side Point; as such, he may roll less than his full alter score if he so chooses.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"78\">Alter Roll &ge;<br />Difficulty By:</td>\n<td width=\"116\">Target pushed back/<br />Collision damage</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"51\">0-5</td>\n<td width=\"92\">2 meters / 2D</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"51\">6-10</td>\n<td width=\"92\">3 meters / 3D</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"51\">11-15</td>\n<td width=\"92\">5 meters / 4D</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"51\">16-20 <br />21+</td>\n<td width=\"92\">10 meters / 5D<br />15 meters / 6D</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
