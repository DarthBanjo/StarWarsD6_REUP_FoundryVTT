    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The lightsaber, simple in design yet difficult to wield and master, features a hand grip hilt that projects a blade of pure energy. The traditional weapon of the Jedi, the lightsaber stands as a symbol of their skill, dedication, and authority.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The blade of a lightsaber is generated by an energy cell and focused through crystals within the hilt. The saber can cut through most materials (except another lightsaber blade, an energy shield, or a few exotic materials), given enough time. Because only the hand grip has any weight, unskilled users have difficulty judging the position of the blade. The lightsaber&rsquo;s true potential becomes apparent in the hands of a fully trained Jedi, who can defend and attack with the weapon, deflecting shots or striking opponents with the glowing blade. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">A lightsaber requires a special energy cell to operate (the cost is ten times the price of an ordinary energy cell, but it lasts almost indefinitely).</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The weapons are extremely rare artifacts &mdash; they are very rarely found for sale and possession of a lightsaber was highly illegal in the Empire.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Cost: </span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Unavailable for sale</span></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Availability: </span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle2\">4, X</span></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Game Notes: </span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle2\">in an attacking character misses the difficulty number by more than 10 points (the base difficulty; not their opponent&rsquo;s parry total), the character has injured himself with the lightsaber blade. Apply normal damage to the character wielding the blade.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Developer's note:</strong> The user's melee strength modifier is automaticaly added is added to lightsaber damage rolls. Damage can be manually adjusted each roll, or your GM can make use of the active effect stored on the lightsaber (<em>data.strengthdamage.mod</em>) to cancel out the players' melee strength bonus. Set it to a negative value.</p>\n<p><em>For example: </em>&nbsp;Sroff has a Strength of 2D. By default, FoundryVTT adds his strength to the lightsaber's damage of 5D, dealing 7D damage when Sroff attacks.&nbsp; Sroff's gamemaster opens the Effects tab, and edits the lightaber active effect there. Under that effect tab, there is a value for data.strengthdamage.mod, which Sroff's gamemaster sets to -6 to counteract the automatic melee attack bonus (every 3 pips adds up to a whole die, hence 6).</p>",
