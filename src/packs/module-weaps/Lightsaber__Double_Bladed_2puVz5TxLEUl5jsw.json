    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The double-bladed lightsaber consists of two sabers fused at their hilts. These weapons are rare and require even greater skill to wield than single-bladed lightsabers. One or both blades can be ignited at once.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">A double-bladed lightsaber requires two special energy cells to operate (the cost of each is ten times the price of an ordinary energy cell, but it lasts almost indefinitely).</span></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Cost: </span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Not available for sale</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Availability:</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">4, X</span></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Game Notes: </span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Proper use of a double-bladed lightsaber requires the specialization </span><em><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Lightsaber: Double-Bladed Lightsaber</span></em><span class=\"fontstyle2\">. Without the proper specialization, the difficulty to use a double-bladed lightsaber is one grade higher than normal (i.e., Very Difficult), and none of the special benefits of the double-bladed lightsaber may be used. If used with only a single blade projected, a double-bladed lightsaber is treated as if it were a normal lightsaber. If properly trained, a Jedi wielding a double-bladed lightsaber gains a +5 bonus to all </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">parry </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">rolls made when both lightsaber blades are extended. If an attacking character misses the difficulty number by more than 10 points (the base difficulty; not their opponent&rsquo;s parry total), the character has injured himself with the lightsaber. Apply normal damage to the character wielding the lightsaber.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Developer's note:</strong> The user's melee strength modifier is automaticaly added is added to lightsaber damage rolls. Damage can be manually adjusted each roll, or your GM can make use of the active effect stored on the Double-Bladed Lightsaber (<em>data.strengthdamage.mod</em>) to cancel out the players' melee strength bonus. Set it to a negative value.</p>\n<p><em>For example:&nbsp;</em> Sroff has a Strength of 2D. By default, FoundryVTT adds his strength to the lightsaber's damage of 5D, dealing 7D damage when Sroff attacks.&nbsp; Sroff's gamemaster opens the Effects tab, and edits the lightaber active effect there. Under that effect tab, there is a value for data.strengthdamage.mod, which Sroff's gamemaster sets to -6 to counteract the automatic melee attack bonus (every 3 pips adds up to a whole die, hence 6).</p>",
