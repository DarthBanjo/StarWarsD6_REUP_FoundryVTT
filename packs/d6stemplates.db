The most notable member of the species was Ikrit who was a Jedi Master during both the centuries of the Galactic Republic and Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order.<br /><br /><strong>Physiology &amp; Description:</strong><br />Distinguishing features included large eyes, floppy ears, and a long tail. They were capable of walking on either their hind legs or on all fours, though to move more quickly in a run or a charge, they had to run with all four appendages. On their hind legs they stood at 0.5 meters tall, with an extra 0.3 meters' worth of tail. They were also a species that had a natural affinity to the Force, though it was in such a calm nature that even other Force-users often passed by a Kushiban without realizing the inherit Force potential within the small species.</p>\n<p>While often mistaken for cute pets, they were actually intelligent beings with a complex culture as well as both a written and spoken language. They mastered fire (used to frighten away hostile, fire-fearing xinkras) and used technology. Rather than paws, they had hands with opposable thumbs and feet. As a means of communication, a Kushiban's fur changed color in correlation to its mood. A Kushiban in a calm, normal state of emotions was white, while a Kushiban in the deepest of despairs was totally black.<br /><br /><strong>Society &amp; Culture:</strong><br />The Kushiban were mainly farmers and weavers on their homeworld and were famous for their hand-woven textiles which involved growing silkweed and combining it with fur they brushed from their coats daily and then spinning it with thread. The thread would then be used to weave cloth and tapestries in a wide variety of colors.</p>\n<p>While they tended to stay on Kushibah, the occasional Kushiban was called away by wanderlust or a specific need. The Jedi Master Ikrit was the most famous Kushiban who has strayed from Kushibah. Given their remoteness from the rest of the Galaxy, it is unknown what role the species and their homeworld played in galactic history.</p>\n<p>A member of this species were noted as being venerable at the age of 110 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Move:&nbsp;</strong>6/8<br /><strong>Size:</strong>&nbsp;0.5 meters tall</p>\n<p><strong>Source:&nbsp;</strong>Wookieepedia (For the Kushiban Description), D6Holocron for the attributes.</p>","labels":{},"tags":[],"attributes":{"agi":{"min":9,"max":15},"str":{"min":3,"max":8},"kno":{"min":4,"max":12},"mec":{"min":3,"max":12},"per":{"min":5,"max":13},"tec":{"min":3,"max":12},"met":{"min":3,"max":15}},"items":[{"name":"Nimble","type":"specialability","description":"<p>Kushiban gain a +1D bonus to Climbing/Jumping skill checks that involve jumping or leaping, as well as a +1D bonus to all Dodge skill rolls.</p>\n<p><strong>Source: </strong>Kushiban</p>"},{"name":"Mood Fur","type":"specialability","description":"<p>&nbsp;A Kushiban's fur changes color with its emotional state.&nbsp;A Kushiban in a calm, normal state of emotions was white, while a Kushiban in the deepest of despairs was totally black.</p>\n<p><strong>Source: </strong>Kushiban</p>"},{"name":"Cute Appearance","type":"specialability","description":"<p>Kushiban are perceived by many species to be cute and cuddly.

It is possible that these superficial features were the result of external factors in the biosphere of their ice-locked homeworld&nbsp;Csilla. Their coloration was said to be caused by the same atmospheric minerals that gave Csilla's glaciers their distinctive bluish tinge, and while less is known about the reasons for their distinctive glowing red eyes, an environmental reaction does seem to be involved, as Chiss eyes were observed to glow more brightly in more oxygenated atmospheres.</p>\n<p>Beyond these potentially superficial differences, it is not clear how far the Chiss diverged from Human norms. Although both Chiss and Humans speculated about distinct physiological differences, for instance in the vocal apparatus or skeletal structure, there is no firm proof of stark evolutionary differences. One theory put forward is that the Chiss were in fact descended from an ancient group of Human colonists who settled in the&nbsp;Unknown Regions&nbsp;long before the foundation of the&nbsp;Galactic Republic&nbsp;and were subsequently forgotten. There was, in fact, a Human sleeper ship colony established on&nbsp;Csilla&nbsp;around 27,500 BBY, though records of this were virtually nonexistent and it remained unknown how a remote area of the galaxy could have been trailblazed so far back.</p>\n<p>It does seem that the Chiss possessed a faster-than-average metabolic rate, leading to a distinctively lean physique and maturity considered reached at around age ten or twelve.</p>\n<p>The Chiss are a proud and highly intelligent species, valuing a knack for strategy and subterfuge over brute force. Although isolated in the Unknown Regions of the galaxy within their so-called &ldquo;Chiss Ascendency,&rdquo; the Chiss were singled out by the Empire as potential servants and allies because of their outsider status and their relative lack of moral qualms. It is not that Chiss are by nature evil, but that they value pragmatism and efficiency and recognize both those qualities reflected in the Empire. While as a nonhuman, non-Sith species, Chiss are regarded as second-class citizens within the Empire, the Chiss Ascendancy is permitted self-governance and supporters of a more diverse Empire often use the Chiss as an example of what the Empire can accomplish by welcoming other species. A few rare Chiss have even achieved official rank in the Imperial military and Imperial Intelligence.</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Dice:</strong> 12D<br /><strong>DEXTERITY: </strong>1D+1/4D<br /><strong>KNOWLEDGE: </strong>1D+1/4D<br /><strong>MECHANICAL:</strong> 1D+1/4D<br /><strong>PERCEPTION:</strong> 1D+1/4D<br /><strong>STRENGTH:</strong> 1D+1/4D<br /><strong>TECHNICAL: </strong>1D+1/4D</p>\n<p><strong>Move: </strong>10/12<br /><strong>Size: </strong>1.6 to 2.1 meters tall.<br /><strong>Average lifespan: </strong>up to 80 years old</p>\n<p><strong>Special Abilities:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Low Light Vision: Chiss can see twice as far as a normal human in poor lighting conditions.</li>\n<li>Skill Bonuses: At the time of character creation only, Chiss characters gain 2D for every one die they assign to the Tactics, Command, and Scholar: Art skills.</li>\n<li>Tactics: Chiss characters receive a permanent +1D bonus to all Tactics skill rolls.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Source:&nbsp;</strong>Galaxy Guide 16 - The Old Republic p. 150</p>","labels":{},"tags":[],"attributes":{"agi":{"min":6,"max":12},"str":{"min":6,"max":12},"kno":{"min":6,"max":12},"mec":{"min":6,"max":12},"per":{"min":6,"max":12},"tec":{"min":6,"max":12},"met":{"min":3,"max":15}},"items":[{"name":"Low Light Vision","type":"specialability","description":"<p>This character can see twice as far as a normal human in poor lighting conidtions.
