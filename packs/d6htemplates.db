They fought the huge lampfish, the ravenous blutfish and the cunning squiges with the strength of their arm, the speed of their legs, with simple spear and net. In the old days, they had none of the weapons and equipment you have. The Quarren have gotten soft,your old da would say, soft and weak. If so, it's the Calamaris who are to blame. They've civilized the Quarren - ha. Tamed them, more's the truth.<br>It is the Calamari who brought the Offworlder trouble to your planet, as well. They had to go into space - as if there wasn't enough bounty right here, in the rich oceans of Mon Calamari, for everyone!

That's you. You're still young at this game, but you've killed 23 people. The galaxy stinks but you've gotta make a living. Some say you've got no morals at all. That's not true.

The moment the imperial soldiers landed on your planet, you knew, deep down your bones, that they would have to be destroyed. Though they attempted to hide it, your warrior's senses knew, somehow, that they were enemies. You tried to tell your people, tried to warn them, but they wouldn't listen. <br>You, at least, were not surprised when the Imperials took over your world. You fought against them as best you could, but your world had few starfighters; the enemy had many and your ship was quickly overwhelmed. You spent most of the Occupation years in an Imperial prison. Since the Imperials were pushed off your planet and you were freed, you have been fighting for the Alliance, doing what you do best: flying small starships. The designs have changed a bit since you last were in space - you're somewhat older, perhaps just a bit slower, as well - but the job's still the same: your mind and your skills against the enemy's. Kill him; survive if you can. <br>Your people may not understand or appreciate you, but that's not important. You're a warrior, and they need you: that's all that matters. <br>Note:<br>Personality:<br> Quiet, almost sedate. You do what needs to be done, with little fanfare, little emotion. You're a killer, but you take no pleasure in it: it's just what you are. <br>Objectives:<br>Connection With Characters:<br> You might have been imprisoned with another Calamarian or Quarren; you might have served in the Alliance Fleet with an Offworlder. <br>Source: <br>See Also:<br>Brash Pilot (Template)<br>Hot-Shot Pilot<br>Rookie New Republic Pilot<br>TIE Fighter Pilot<br>Typical Rebel Pilot<br>Mon Calamari<br>Average Mon Calamari<br>MON CALAMARI TEMPLATES<br>Mon Calamari<br>Mon Calamari Courier<br>Mon Calamari Crewman<br>Mon Calamari Mediator<br>Mon Calamari Medic<br>Mon Calamari Professor<br>Mon Calamari Spacer<br>Mon Calamari Technician<br>Back to Templates<br>","labels":{},"tags":[],"species":"Mon Calamari","attributes":{"agi":8,"str":9,"kno":8,"mec":12,"per":7,"tec":10,"met":0},"fp":0,"cp":0,"funds":0,"credits":1000,"move":"4","me":"false","items":{},"label":"OD6S.CHARACTER_TEMPLATES","effects":[],"folder":"null","sort":0},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"HLIXOpj36O1GrtQa":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.5kmkBjGRhSasG0BE"}}}

Selling Wookiees across the galaxy to perish in hellish work camps, they made a profit from your people's suffering. Now with the Empire shattered, the slaving has stopped, but the pain remains.<br>You were once a slave yourself, but were rescued from captivity by fellow Wookiees who had managed to avoid capture. You now consider all enslaved Wookiees to be members of your clan. You are sworn to restore all enslaved Wookiees to freedom and hunt down those responsible for their capitivity. They will answer for their crimes. <br>Personality:<br> You will accept any job involving a slaver. Relentless in your pursuit, even to the point of going into debt, you let nothing stand in your way once you've picked up the trail. You abide by the New Republic's rules concerning the caputre and treatment of those you pursue, but you can't help it if they resist. In fact, sometimes you hope they do. <br>Objectives:<br> To find the slavers and their allies who profited by enslaving Wookiees.<br>Note:<br> The player should be able to do a good impersonation of a Wookiee — sounding like Chewbacca is pretty important to successfully playing this character. Next, see if any of the characters speaks Wookiee — if you have a close friendship with one of the other characters, such as a smuggler, they can probably understand you pretty well. A protocol droid will almost always be able to understand you. If no one around speaks Wookiee, the characters will have to make language rolls to understand you (the easier the idea or concept, the lower the language difficulty). To say something, growl and have each character roll to see if they understand you. If they succeed, tell them what your character just said; if they fail, growl some more and play charades<br>Source:<br> Heroes and Rogues<br>Back to Templates<br>","labels":{},"tags":[],"species":"Wookiee","attributes":{"agi":10,"str":15,"kno":7,"mec":7,"per":7,"tec":8,"met":0},"fp":0,"cp":0,"funds":0,"credits":1500,"move":"11","me":"false","items":{},"label":"OD6S.CHARACTER_TEMPLATES","effects":[],"folder":"null","sort":0},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"HLIXOpj36O1GrtQa":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.6Ex9QRvpGiItpd6G"}}}

The Navy was your job, your life, and your passion. You rose through its ranks, from enlisted trooper to petty officer to command of a starship.

Next, see if any of the characters speaks Wookiee — if you have a close friendship with one of the other characters, such as a smuggler, they can probably understand you pretty well. A protocol droid will almost always be able to understand you. If no one around speaks Wookiee, the characters will have to make language rolls to understand you (the easier the idea or concept, the lower the language difficulty). To say something, growl and have each character roll to see if they understand you.

As a child of the nobility, you grew up in a privileged household, wanting for nothing.<br>However, as you grew older and began traveling to other worlds, you discovered that life is much harder elsewhere-and that the Empire is much crueler. Unable to find happiness in an Empire that crushes everything that offends it, you began to look for ways to oppose it.<br>With some careful searching, you discovered likeminded people with connections to the Rebellion and convinced them to trust you. You attended a Rebel training camp under cover of a vacation, and after several weeks of basic espionage and military training, you are back in Tapani sector, ready to take the war to the Empire.<br>Personality:<br> You are extremely sharp and resoruceful, but you hide this side of yourself from your peers in the nobility-it wouldn't do for them to suspect you are capable of doing the sorts of things you plan to do the Imperials in Tapani sector.

You've been a Senator for more years than you care to count; you've gotten white-haired and dried up in that time.  It seems like your struggle with Palpatine and his henchmen has gone on forever.  A never-ending struggle for the very soul of the Senate and the galaxy, a struggle which consumed the years of youth like butterflies in a flame.  You'll not give up yet!  The fight has passed beyond the Senate chamber into the hard vacuum of space.  You can't fly a starship or fire a laser cannon, but determination, an understanding of your adversaries, and an ability to command still counts for something.  Still, still...you yearn for the old days, for men like Talon, Kenobi, and (heaven help us) Skywalker.

It is certainly a fun life, and you couldn't ask for anything more - fighting stormtroopers, saving people from the Empire, putting crawly insects inside some bounty hunter's armor.... you know, some of these folks have absolutely no sense of humor!<br>Note:<br>Personality:<br> You can be constantly cheerful, always siding with the underdog. You're completely loyal to one other character (you choose which) and tag along with him.<br>Objectives:<br>To find cool things to do and to stop the Empire... and whatever else crosses your mind as fun, interesting, and more than a little likely to get you into trouble. <br>Connection With Characters:<br> Choose another player character as your older sibling /adopted parent/ idol/ whatever. You don't have to get the other player's permission. In fact, if he or she is annoyed, that's entirely appropriate. <br>Source:<br> Star Wars RPG 2nd Edition Revised and Expanded<br>","labels":{},"tags":[],"species":"","attributes":{"agi":11,"str":7,"kno":8,"mec":9,"per":11,"tec":8,"met":0},"fp":0,"cp":0,"funds":0,"credits":25,"move":"8","me":"false","items":{},"label":"OD6S.CHARACTER_TEMPLATES","effects":[],"folder":"null","sort":0},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"HLIXOpj36O1GrtQa":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.QcEWSKxVNERhKACz"}}}

To escape the blood feud which almost wiped out your family, you took passage aboard the first starship heading off the planet. All you brought was a gear bag filled with the few personal belongings you grabbed before your home was sacked and burned. <br>The freighter captain allowed you to work off your passage. You were attracted by the ship's powerful (and probably illegal) weapons. A crewman taught you to use them, and soon you were blasting away at TIE fighters and pirate corvettes.

Innumerable Senators have borne your name. For centuries, your family has selflessly sacrificed for the good of the state and society. You have served loyally and well, and because of it, the citizens of your planet are loyal to your house. Since the Empire was established, your family has tried to fend off its evil ways and to hold the Emperor to his promise to promote the public good. Even now, you are reluctant to turn against the galactic government which your family supported for so long ago. Yet you have no choice. The Empire has truly become a tyranny. Your home planet is occupied by stormtroopers. If civilization is to be saved, you must act now. Your family will provide leadership to the Rebellion, as it did to the Republic. <br>Note:<br>Personality:<br>Intelligent, confident and energetic.

Since you're well known in the Alliance, a Mon Calamari or mere might have served with you before.

The hours are long, the working conditions terrible; chances are, you'll wind up crippled or dead before your time is due. <br>But it's all you've ever known. Your family has always worked the deepmines. Your mother was killed in a decompression accident in the south mines shortly after you were born; your grandfather died of the wetlung at the age of 32; your father at 36. But it's the only life you know. <br>When the Offworlders - the Empire, that is - took over, things got even worse. They cut your pay and worked you even harder; they killed you if you gave them any lip. All of the gains the miners had made over the years - the union, the better working conditions, the danger pay - were washed away when the first Imperial ship landed. <br>Everyone knew the south mines were unsafe: they had been closed for years, ever since the accident which killed your mother. But the Offworlders forced them opened again, forced you and your fellows to work there. It was only luck, pure, blind luck, that the water seal blew while you were off-shift. Fifty-seven of your brothers weren't so lucky. That's when you said \"enough\". That's when you decided that those murderers weren't fit to live. You and your brothers chased them off this planet; you'll not stop until they're erased from the galaxy.<br>Personality:<br> Bitter, silent, consumed with hatred for the Empire, you have great loyalty to those you work with (though you can never express it with words). You don't shirk from hard work or danger, and you never give up. <br>Your one weakness is for drink: you go without for months, then, for no reason, you may go on a heroic binge which lasts for days.

Your life needed more excitement.<br>When SoroSuub announced its intention to side with the Empire, you fled the planet. You thought about joining the Rebel Alliance, but you weren't about to die for any cause. You wanted a life of thrills which paid a little dividend. So you joined up with a free-trader and put your technical skills to work maintaining the crummy bucket of scrap he called a freighter. Now and then the captain ran into some difficulties with the Empire, rival smugglers, crime lords and bounty hunters. This often meant the ship became more damaged, and you got more frustrated trying to fix everything before it all blew up. Still, you have your life of adventure. Plus a few extra credits from the captain's lucrative smuggling runs. <br>Personality:<br> Usually you're easy-going, but when things heat up in the engineering bay, you get flustered and anxioous. You feel you have to fix everything all at once. <br>Objectives:<br> To keep the freighter on tip-top condition with as little work as possible.

But ... the Empire is more and more restrictive by the day. Goods that used to be legal are now contraband. Even contraband is harder and harder to come by. Customs inspectors are like bloodhounds.

To you, your ship is home, transportation, and freedom, all in one package. The idea of losing it kills you. <br>But you may very well lose it. To keep on operating, you had to borrow money from a mobster, a real slimeball crime king. You're pretty deep in debt now, and they keep on making nasty jokes about breaking your kneecaps.

When you were young, you quickly mastered the family landspeeder, pushing it to the limit. Later you tried speeder bikes, swoops and airspeeders. Each time you pulled wild stunts, overrode the speed safety parameters, and barely avoided dangerous obstacles. You had good luck with machines.<br>When you left home, you journeyed to the largest spaceport on your planet. There you joined the planetary militia's flight unit, flying airspeeders and ancient snub fighters to protect shipping in your system.

Encouraged by your parents, you apprenticed yourself to a famous Herglic sculpture who worked for the Tapani houses. Your master taught you the fine points of sculpting, but just as he was reaching his prime, he was blacklisted by the houses eager to curry favor with the Empire by emphasizing human art. <br>Ironically, the blacklist did wonders for your own career. Even as your master and other alien artists were forced out of work, young talented humans like yourself experienced a windfall of contracts and sponsorships. Your master encouraged you to pursue these, but you still felt guilty doing so. <br>You have since succeeded as an artist, and have attracted a small but growing circle of fans among the artistically-inclined members of the Tapani elite. Still, you have misgivings about the Empire, and wonder when they'll decide that your art too is no longer desirable.<br>Personality:<br> You are wildly creative and slightly eccentric. Fortunately, people expect artist to be a little strange, and your skill gives you leeway to be yourself. You tend to get intensely focused on a problem to the exclusion of all else.<br>Objectives: <br> To become the most recognized and lauded sculptor in Tapani sector, and possibly beyond. To redress the wrong done to your master and his peers.<br>Connection With Other Characters:<br> Tapani nobles and Imperial elites are likely present or past sponsors.

Your people are peaceful and gentle; you shared your homeworld of Calamari with the Quarren for millennia. Over the centuries, you gradually built a technological civilization and a high culture. Exploration of nearby stars was well underway — and then the Empire came. The Imperials saw only an undefended prize — an advanced world that could be forced to feed the Imperial war machine. They invaded and enslaved your people. At first, you did not understand what had been done. The idea of slavery was incomprehensible. You tried to appease the invaders, but nothing worked. Eventually, the Mon Calamari began to fight back—and when they did, the Empire reacted with incredible ferocity. Whole cities were obliterated. Then, virtually the whole Mon Calamari people rose as one and destroyed the occupiers. The war industries the Empire had forced its slave laborers to build are now used for another purpose — to fuel the Rebellion. You were on Calamari when the Empire came; you helped when the uprising succeeded. Now, you are part of the Calamarian armed forces, a part of the Rebel Alliance against the Empire. <br>Personality:<br>You excel with high-pressure, maximum concentration jobs because of your discipline and have a notoriously even temper.

You decided a long time ago that - while the profit margin is higher on items like guns and spice - bacta was a lower-risk cargo. <br>Borrowing enough money to fix up a battered light freighter, you traveled to Tapani sector, hoping to cash in on the region's lucrative bacta trade.

You've read as much as you can about the Jedi training methods and their powers, and you've tried to train yourself as best you can.

You joined the Queen's Own Grenadiers as a youth, and saw a little action on one campaign. Your Queen sent you (and others of her servants) to find out more about the galaxy and what contact with it might mean. You send her reports weekly -- but you're increasingly worried.

Never went to school; never had a job - never paid any taxes either, come to think of it. That was the life! You ran errands for the Underworld Big Fish, hustled the tourists - particularly the Mon Cals: you loved taking their money! - and, when unavoidable, did piece-work (information-selling, mainly) for the government.<br>Things got a whole lot less fun when the Imperials came, though. Suddenly, it became illegal to work the streets, and not having a job made you bait for any two-cred lieutenant who needed to up his arrest record for the month. You were no longer a hustler (an honorable profession, to be sure): now you were a hunted criminal. You took up the fight against the Empire not for any foolish cause: you fought them to survive.<br>Now that they're gone, you've tried to go back to your old way of life, but it's no the same, somehow. Though you'd never admit it, you enjoyed the struggle to drive the Empire off of your planet.

You were just a kid when he jumped to the Rebels, and you idolized him like he was a hero out of a holo-thriller. Then word came that he was blown up in his A-wing over Endor. You joined the New Republic military to fly a starfighter. You're good at it. You love it. And it seemed the only way to truly honor your brother's memory. Sometimes it feels like he's flying with you: when things look their worst and there is no way out, you manage to come up with the last-minute solution to desperate problems.

This made you worried: you might be blown up next. So you decided to run far, far away.

You were about to become a proud warrior in your city-state when spacers took you from your primitive homeworld and put you to work for them.

You are no longer a slave, but a free-willed crewmember with a salary and future of your own. You don't have many starship skills, so you work as a crate-buster.
