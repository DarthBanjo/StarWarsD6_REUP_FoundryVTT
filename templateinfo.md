mcbobbo has provided a text export of the D6 Holocron's character templates. These act like character classes and provide a quick way to get a game up and running. There are however, 180ish of them. 

# **Developer's Notes**
- D6holocron had some homebrew templates on them, I have balanced the Jedi Sentinel, Jedi Guardian, and Jedi Consular by reducing the number of Force Powers they start with from 9 to 3.
- I will standardize the character and force points that each template begins with in order to match the rulebook. (Some started with 10CP, some with 5CP. Now they all have 5CP, and 1 force point if they are not force sensitive. 2 if they are.)

# **Generalization:** 
As I was working on these templates, I realized some of them were too specific and would never see play out of a narrow set of games. I will take the artistic license to update the names of some of the templates to fix this. When the game was released, these templates had names that included some species, or whether they worked for the Alliance or Imperials. 
The purpose of this is so that:
- different species may more easily be added by selecting a different species template.
- different time periods may more easily be played in and still make use of the same templates.

I will document the changes in this file.
