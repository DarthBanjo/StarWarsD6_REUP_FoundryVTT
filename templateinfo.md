mcbobbo has provided a text export of the D6 Holocron's character templates. These act like character classes and provide a quick way to get a game up and running. There are however, 180ish of them. When the game was released, these templates had names that included some species. I will take the artistic license to update the names of some of them, so that different species may more easily be added by selecting a different species template.

I will document the changes in this file.
