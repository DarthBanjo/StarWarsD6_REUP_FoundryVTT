mcbobbo has provided a text export of the D6 Holocron's character templates. These act like character classes and provide a quick way to get a game up and running. There are however, 180ish of them. 

# **Developer's Notes**
- D6holocron had some homebrew templates on them, I have balanced the Jedi Sentinel, Jedi Guardian, and Jedi Consular by reducing the number of Force Powers they start with from 9 to 3.
- I updated the Clone Template homebrew template to be more in line with the Clone Trooper gamemaster character from the REUP rulebook.
- I standardized the character and force points that each template begins with in order to match the rulebook. (Some started with 10CP, some with 5CP. Now they all have 5CP, and 1 force point if they are not force sensitive. 2 if they are.)
- I added (A) Podracing to the "Speeder Racer" template.
- I added Artist as a Perception skill instead of Knowledge (to match OpenD6 Space) (this skill came from the Freeworlds Artist template)
- I added the Artist skill to the Holovid celebrity. I'll probably also add it to the Snivvian Artist.
- I added Equipment Repair to some engineer/tinker-types, since this Technical skill was added after most of these templates were created.
- A few of the Quarren Templates were written so poorly.. I felt that the Deep Hunter especially was a missed opportunity to work on aquatic vehicles. I added those skills.
- I created the Sith Apprentice to add some variety and allow for a dark-side force user, based off a gamemaster character from Galaxy Guide 16.
- I added the Peacemaker template based off a character in the Tales of the Jedi Companion.
- I added (A) Computer Engingeering to the Slicer template.
- I found some homebrew Dark Side templates in Galaxy Guide 14: The Dark Side. Their stats were all balanced at 18D, but their starting Force powers and equipment were not. I have included these four, but reduced their number of starting powers/equipment for balance. I've increased their starting Dark Side Points to 3 each to match the Sith Apprentice gamemaster character. I may have also rewritten background and personality capsules.
    - Fallen Jedi
    - Dark Jedi Warrior
    - Banished Noble
    - Alien Sith Warrior
- I changed the skills assigned to the Quarren Miner. They started with the 1E skill list and I added some skills that a miner might have. I also added a beamdrill and vibropick to their starting equipment.

# **Generalization:** 
As I was working on these templates, I realized some of them were too specific and would never see play out of a narrow set of games.  When the game was released, these templates had names that included some species, or whether they worked for the Alliance or Imperials.

I will take the artistic license to update the names of some of the templates to fix this. The purpose of this is so that:
- different species may more easily be added by selecting a different species template.
- different time periods may more easily be played in and still make use of the same templates.
- I understand this might yield multiple templates that are very similar. (Rodian Gunner and Ship's Gunner come to mind, and Liaison/Military Liaison) That's ok, a player or GM can pick the best one for their games. 

I will document the changes in this file.
