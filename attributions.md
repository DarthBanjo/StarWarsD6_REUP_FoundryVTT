# This is the document for all the Creative Commons Attributions. 
Changes were probably made by running the Creative Commons work through Tokentool to create .webp icons and add a border. This document is a reasonable attempt to attribute appropriately, but this is not to suggest that the licensor endorses this project or the use of the artwork.

If you expand the equipIcons directory, you will see a folder structure that explains where each icon came from.
